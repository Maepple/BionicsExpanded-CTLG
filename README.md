# Bionics Expanded
*Bionics Expanded* (BE) is a content mod for *Cataclysm: The Last Generation* (CTLG), consisting of bionics which I just thought would be fun to create. 

### Content
The current implemented bionics include:
- Chemical Synthesis CBM
- Dragon's Breath CBM
- Variable Dispersion Arrays CBM

### Found a Bug?
If you find a bug/crash which you believe may be caused by this mod, make sure to either:
- Create a github issue
- DM me directly or ping me on the TLG server

### Confused About a Mod Feature?
Any questions you might have can be directed at me through DM-ing or pinging me through discord. I'll (probably) respond in a timely manner if I'm not sleeping or otherwise busy.
