# Bionics Expanded
*Bionics Expanded* (BE) is a content mod for *Cataclysm: The Last Generation* (CTLG), consisting of bionics which I just thought would be fun to create. 

### Content
The current implemented bionics include:
- Chemical Synthesis CBM
- Dragon's Breath CBM
- Variable Dispersion Arrays CBM

### Installation Instructions
1. Download the src code in the latest mod release
2. Unzip the file in the 'data\mods' directory

### FAQ
- **Q1**: I'm trying to use the Dragon's Breath/VDA bionics, and it's saying, "Gas reserves are too low!" What do I do?
- **A1**: All gas-based bionics require the ***Chemical Synthesizer*** bionic to function, as they utilise gas reserves within the user to function.
- **Q2**: Why is my character's health is extremely low after synthesizing chemicals?
- **A2**: Synthesizing chemicals is not free! It takes time and bionic power and reduces the user's health to simulate the bionic taking resources from the user's body.

### Found a Bug?
If you find a bug/crash which you believe may be caused by this mod, make sure to either:
- Create a github issue
- DM me directly or ping me on the TLG server

### Confused About a Mod Feature?
Any questions you might have can be directed at me through DM-ing or pinging me through discord. I'll (probably) respond in a timely manner if I'm not sleeping or otherwise busy.
